## Installation

Add `add_to_gallery` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

## Permissions

You need the following permissions in your app:

- **iOS**
  - `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`
  - This allows the plugin to use the [PHPhotoLibrary](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/phphotolibrary/) APIs to add assets to the user's photo library.
- **Android**
  - `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
  - `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
  - If you target Android 10, you will also need the [requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/use-cases#opt-out-in-production-app) in your AndroidManifest.

This plugin **does not** manage permissions for you. _By excluding permissions from our plugin we have created a simple, reliable plugin._

We recommend using [permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) to handle permissions.

## Usage

There's only one method. It copies the source file to the gallery and returns the new file.

```dart
File file = await AddToGallery.addToGallery(
  originalFile: File('/Some/Media/Path.jpg'),
  deleteOriginalFile: false,
);
print("Savd to gallery with Path: ${file.path}");
```

Using [permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler), this may look like:

```dart
try {
  // iOS
  if (!await Permission.photos.request().isGranted) {
    throw ('Permission Required');
  }
  // Android (10 and below)
  if (!await Permission.storage.request().isGranted) {
    throw ('Permission Required');
  }
  // Add to the gallery
  File file = await AddToGallery.addToGallery(
    originalFile: File('/Some/Media/Path.jpg'),
    deleteOriginalFile: true,
  );
  print("Savd to gallery with Path: ${file.path}");
} catch(e) {
  print("Error: $e");
}
```

## Example app

The [example app](/example) shows a few more edge-cases in action.

- Uses [permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) to request permissions
- Uses [image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker) to take photos with the camera
- Copies assets to the gallery
- Uses [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) to save and read the file path locally
  - _This shows that the assets are still accessible between reboots_

## Credits & Comparison

Add to Gallery is based on [gallery_saver](https://pub.dev/packages/gallery_saver) with some notable differences. Enough to warrant a new package rather than a pull-request. Generally speaking, I've simplified the API and unified the behaviour on iOS and Android. It also supports scoped storage on Android (which will be [enforced with Android 11](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage))

Big thanks to the [Tecocraft LTD team](https://www.tecocraft.co.uk/) for Android functionality on Android 10 and 11.

## An Important Note about Google photos

Google Photos has a built-in feature to remove exact duplicates. It can be confusing to see your media disappearing like this. I considered addressing this behaviour in the plugin, but decided against it. I expect plugin users to be creating unique images with the camera or other methods.
